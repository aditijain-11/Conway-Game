# Conway's Game of Life
This repository features an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game unfolds on a two-dimensional grid where cells evolve through generations based on simple rules. In this JavaScript rendition, a grid of cells is displayed on an HTML page, with the state of each cell dynamically updated over time. The cells evolve based on their neighbors, leading to interesting patterns and behaviors. The code utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing representation of Conway's Game of Life. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to witness the emergence of fascinating patterns within the cellular automaton.
